<div class="data">
Bipolar disorder (BD) is a highly impairing illness; when it occurs in children and adolescents, it tends to run a particularly severe course.  Children with BD typically require extensive treatment with medication and, often, hospitalization.  They have high rates of suicide attempts and have great difficulty navigating normal developmental milestones.  Pediatric BD takes a very significant toll on children afflicted with the disease and their families. Thus, there is an urgent public health need for research on pediatric bipolar disorder. <br /><br />The goal of our research is to elucidate brain mechanisms mediating BD in youth, and to identify brain-based and clinical markers of risk for the disorder. Such research will identify targets for future treatment development, as well as lay the groundwork for research aimed at eventually preventing the development of illness in children at risk.  <br /><br />Specifically, we use standardized behavioral paradigms to assess processing of emotional stimuli (e.g. responses to reward and punishment, processing of emotional faces) in youth with bipolar disorder and in youth at risk for bipolar disorder by virtue of having a parent or sibling with the illness.  In addition, we compare adults and children with bipolar disorder, using both behavioral testing and fMRI, to determine how the neural circuitry mediating bipolar disorder varies developmentally.  We are also following the symptoms of Amish youth who have a first-degree relative with bipolar disorder and mutations of interest for the illness. <br /><br />We are testing the hypotheses that 1) children and adults with bipolar disorder, or at familial risk for the illness, will have deficits labeling face emotion; 2)children and adults with bipolar disorder, or at familial risk for the disorder, will have increased attentional lapses, especially in the context of emotional stimuli; 3) both the attentional and the face emotion processing deficits will be mediated by dysfunction in ventral prefrontal-amygdala-parietal circuitry, but the precise nature of the neural deficit mediating differences between patients and controls will vary developmentally; 4) during implicit processing of emotional faces, patients with, or at risk for, bipolar disorder will show a distinct pattern of neural dysfunction, relative to patients with anxiety disorders or severe irritability. Behavioral hypotheses are initially tested using standardized computerized tasks in the lab an functional MRI is used to idenitfy dysfunctional neural circuitry that may be mediating those differences. Also, since little is known about the longitudinal course of pediatric BD, we follow our patients longitudinally to ascertain their response to treatment and prognosis.  <br /><br />For several years, the project has included work in children at familial risk for bipolar disorder (i.e., those with a parent or sibling with the illness). This work is designed to identify biomarkers that index risk for illness, so that the illness can be deteched earlier and, eventually, prevented.  This year, we have begun to expand this aspect of the project to include work in genetically informative isolates, such as the Amish community. Our goal is to obtain genetic material from children with a parent with bipolar disoder and a putatively information genetic mutation, assess the children clinically, and follow them longitudinally to determine who ultimately develops bipolar disorder.  <br /><br />This work is conducted under protocol 00-M-0198, NCT00006177.

Summary
 </div></div>
 
 <div class="rowdiv">
<div class="data">
Since the beginning of this project we have screened over 2200 subjects for this study. We have enrolled approximately 135 youth with bipolar disorder (BD), 130 subjects at risk for BD because they have a parent or sibling with the illness, and 120 adults with BD. This year, approximately 20 new subjects were enrolled.<br /><br />This year we continued our work designed to identify the brain mechanisms underlying BD in children; compare brain function in youth and adults with BD in order to begin to understand how the illness develops over time; and compare brain function in youth at familial risk for BD to those with BD and those at low risk, in order to facilitate the eventual development of preventive interventions.<br /><br />In terms of our work on the brain mechanisms mediating BD, much of that work consists of, not only comparing youth with BD to healthy youth, but also comparing youth with BD to those with severe, chronic irritability (the so-called severe mood dysregulation, or SMD, population, see MH002786-07). It is important to compare youth with BD and those with SMD because the latter frequently receive the diagnosis of BD in the community, despite not having a history of manic episodes. Indeed, this year we published a paper demonstrating that the rate of discharges for pediatric bipolar disorder was 12.5 times higher in the US than England (compared to 3.9 times higher in the US than England for other psychiatric diagnoses). This potential misdiagnosis is important from a therapeutic and public health perspective.  That is, compared to severe, chronic irritability, BD in youth is treated with more toxic medications.  Therefore, it is important to identify accurately youth with BD and not extend the boundaries of the diagnosis inappropriately. <br /><br />In addition to comparing BD with SMD youth, consistent with the new Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach of the NIMH, this year we began to include additional comparison patient populations in our studies, including those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anxiety disorders.  Not only do these populations share with those with BD (and SMD) deficits in attentional and emotional control, but indeed these are the two most common comorbid illnesses in youth with BD. We are currently gathering functional neuroimaging data on these groups on several tasks that follow directly from previous work.  Specifically, we are using an implicit face emotion processing (i.e., gender identification) task and a task designed to identify the mechanisms underlying increased variability in reaction time (generally thought to be an indicator of attentional lapses).  We have focused on these tasks because they relate to the face emotion processing and sustained attention deficits that we and others have identified in both youth and adults with BD, and in youth at risk for the illness (the latter in a paper published this year).  Whereas, in prior work, our goal was to include approximately 20 subjects per group in each study, given concerns about Type I errors in neuroimaging studies in psychiatry and the fact that we are testing hypotheses across multiple groups, in our current studies we aim to recruit at least 40 subjects in each group. Recruitment for these two studies is approximately 40% complete. <br /><br />One notable feature of our work is our recruitment, not only of children with BD, but also adults with the illness and unaffected youth at risk for the illness (as well as appropriate healthy comparison groups).  This strategy allows us to identify possible pathophysiological mechanisms present before the onset of illness as well as across the developmental spectrum in affected individuals. Hence, we published two papers this year that complemented our previous work showing that youth with BD fail to modulate amygdala activity appropriately when viewing angry faces.  Specifically, we found that this deficit is also present in adults with BD and unaffected youth at risk for the illness. Developmental differences were found, however, in subgenual cingulate modulation in response to angry faces. In addition, we found that both youth with BD and those at risk for the illness had decreased modulation of the inferior frontal gyrus (as well as the amygdala) in response to angry faces. <br /><br />Another, related psychological process where we were able to show continuity in deficits across the developmental and pathological spectrum in BD concerns encoding of emotional faces.  In prior work, we have demonstrated a neural and behavioral deficit in emotional face encoding, and this year we published two papers demonstrating similar behavioral deficits in both adults with BD and in those at risk for the illness. Neurally, both adults and youth with BD showed occipital dysfunction during emotional face encoding, whereas youth with or at risk for the illness also showed dysfunction in the parahippocampal gyrsu. We have also continued to establish the relationships that would allow us to assess Amish children at risk for BD, and that work is progressing.<br />
