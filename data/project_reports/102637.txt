<div class="data">
In the cerebral cortex, each excitatory cell receives thousands of synaptic inputs. A central question in neuroscience is how these inputs are summed to produce spiking outputs. For example, in primary sensory cortex, a particular sensory stimulus can evoke different numbers of spikes depending on the behavioral state of the animal, presumably reflecting one sort of summation change  response gain variability.  Theoretical work has characterized an array of input-summation processes that are potentially used by cortical networks, promising to explain generally how cortical networks respond to input. However, it has proven extremely difficult to obtain the experimental data needed to support and test this theoretical work, primarily because sensory stimuli generally affect neural activity within multiple brain regions, each of which could subsequently provide input to the area under study. Optogenetic stimulation, combined with sensory stimuli, can provide critical tests of these theoretical models. In parallel, theoretical work must be performed to extend existing (rate-based) models to incorporate features of real neurons that likely affect input summation (e.g., spike threshold, short-term synaptic plasticity, and conductance changes).<br /><br />To understand how cortical neurons perform computation, we are taking a joint experimental and theoretical approach.  We are measuring how mouse visual cortical neurons respond to combinations of optogenetic and visual input, and using network models to understand the circuit features that shape those input responses.<br /><br />

<div class="data">
In one project, we are developing models of spiking networks that relate neurons responses to circuit and cellular properties.  The theoretical work is being done in collaboration with Nicolas Brunel (Duke), and we are testing predictions in the laboratory using neurophysiology with silicon multi-site probes that allow recording many neurons across cortical layers simultaneously.  Some results have been submitted in abstract form for presentation (Sanzeni et al., Society for Neuroscience meeting, 2017) and are being elaborated into a manuscript (Sanzeni et al., in prep).  A manuscript with an early form of some of these results, obtained via simulation, has been submitted (Histed, under review).  This work is shedding light on what computations the cortex can perform, and what circuit properties like connection number and strengths, are needed to control those computations.<br /><br />In a second project, we are examining how the cortex controls the gain of responses by using a learning paradigm.  Animals and humans improve their performance in sensory tasks with practice.  But it is not known in general whether cortical representations become stronger (response gain increases) with practice, or whether downstream decoding becomes more effective.  To examine the neural basis of learning, we are training animals to perform controlled learning tasks and examining how neural responses change with learning.  We will adapt the models from project 1 to predict what circuit changes might lead to any response changes, and follow up that work with experimental tests of the predictions.  This work will explain how the brain, particularly the cerebral cortex, changes during learning to support improved behavior.  Understanding the circuit elements that change with learning is made possible by insights from theoretical work on networks that relates neural activity to circuit and anatomical features.<br />
