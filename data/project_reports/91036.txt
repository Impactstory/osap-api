Depression risk increases during the perimenopause, and depression is cited as a primary reason for resuming menopausal hormone therapy (HT).  Evidence suggests that even the presence of minor depression can increase all-cause and cardiovascular morbidity in women. Community-based epidemiologic studies document a 1.5-3 fold greater risk of first onset and recurrent depressions in women during the perimenopause compared with those who are premenopausal (or who are several years postmenopausal). The development of depression at midlife is important for several reasons.  First, in addition to the well-documented morbidity related to an episode of depression, depression conveys an increased risk for all-cause mortality in women at midlife as well as the risk for several specific medical illnesses relevant to women at midlife including osteoporosis, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease (CVD).  Second, reproductive endocrine-related mood disorders represent distinct subtypes of depression, since the appearance of symptoms is linked to a change in reproductive function.  Thus, better understanding their unique biology could lead to the development of novel therapeutics for women with these conditions, the need for which is underscored by the constrained effectiveness of antidepressants in achieving remission in major depression (i.e., 28 to 40% efficacy).  Finally, there is considerable overlap between reproductive endocrine-related mood disorders and traditional affective disorders including symptom presentation and shared co-morbidities; nonetheless, reproductive-related mood disorders are distinguished by several characteristics including the linkage of the symptomatic state to a hormone transition and treatment response characteristics (i.e., efficacy of hormonal therapies, selective response to SSRIs versus other classes of antidepressants).  These mood disorders represent the convergent effects of the reproductive trigger and a susceptibility to experience affective dysregulation, since the same biological trigger is without effect on mood in women lacking the susceptibility.  Thus the susceptibility to a hormone-induced mood destabilization must involve differential processing of the hormone signal that leads to an abnormal affective state.  As such, these disorders provide an unparalleled opportunity to uncover the biological and environmental underpinnings of susceptibility to affective dysregulation.  <br />The specific goals and objectives for this project are as follows: 1) Define the role of estradiol withdrawal in the precipitation of depression during the perimenopause.  2) Identify the predictors of the development of depression in the context of menopause-related hypogonadism.  3) Determine the mood and behavioral effects of selective estrogen receptor beta modulators in perimenopause-related depression.  4) Characterize the clinical characteristics and functional impact of disturbances in mood and behavior occurring in the context of ovarian failure.<br />The long-range goals are to identify the mechanisms underlying the effects of gonadal steroids on affective state regulation and the effects of aging on the behavioral and neuroregulatory effects (HPA axis regulation, regional cerebral blood flow) of hypogonadism and gonadal steroid replacement in women.  Finally, we wish to determine the therapeutic utility and predictors of response to hormonal therapies (i.e., gonadal and adrenal steroids) in mood disorders occurring during midlife and the perimenopause.

Summary

 <div class="rowdiv">
<div class="data">
This report includes work arising from the following clinical protocols: NCT00030147, NCT00060736, NCT00001231, and NCT00001322. <br />In addition to the well-documented increased risk of depression, the perimenopause also has been reported to be accompanied by a decreased quality of life (QOL). Studies have not clarified if the decline in QOL is secondary to the vicissitudes on the perimenopause (including distressing hot flushes) or if these changes in QOL reflect the effects of those women with perimenopausal depression (PMD). We have characterized the impact of PMD on QOL, disability, social adjustment and role functioning. Our findings show that PMD is accompanied by a decreased QOL, decreased social adjustment and impaired role functioning comparable to depression and anxiety disorders occurring at other stages of a womans life. Hot flushes did not significantly impact on these measures in either women with PMD or controls. These findings suggest that previous community-based reports of decreased QOL measures in perimenopausal women likely reflects the effects of the subgroup of perimenopausal women experiencing depression. <br />The nature of the relationship between the onset of PMD and hormonal events of the perimenopause remains to be more fully characterized. Observational studies report the emergence of depressive symptoms after the discontinuation of estradiol therapy (ET) in 5-10% of women. The role of estradiol -either declining or low levels - in the precipitation of PMD is unknown, largely due to the associational and indirect nature of the evidence linking ovarian function and depression. Prospective epidemiological studies cannot test the estradiol withdrawal hypothesis since perimenopausal changes in the secretion of several hormonal and metabolic factors could confound the effects of estradiol withdrawal. In other studies of the role of ovarian steroids in affective disturbance, changes in ovarian steroids (in the context of otherwise normal levels) have been shown to directly trigger depression, but only in a subset of women with histories of mood disorders linked to reproductive function.  We determined if sudden, blinded withdrawal of ET would precipitate depressive symptoms and if it would do so differentially in those with a history of PMD. Our findings support both predictions. Estradiol withdrawal precipitated depression in women with a history of PMD, but depressive symptoms emerged in neither women with no past history of PMD after estradiol withdrawal, nor in those women with past PMD who were maintained on ET. Importantly, the recurrence of depressive symptoms in women with past PMD occurred in the absence of differences in several measures that could influence mood, including baseline clinical characteristics (other than PMD), the severity of daytime/nighttime hot-flushes, and plasma hormone levels after withdrawal. The lack of depressive symptoms in the control women despite identical hormone manipulation (and similar levels of hot-flushes and plasma estradiol levels) demonstrates that estradiol withdrawal differentially impacts CNS function in some women so as to render them susceptible to depression. These observations, in the context of similar plasma reproductive hormone levels, suggest that normal changes in ovarian estradiol secretion can trigger an abnormal behavioral state in susceptible women.  There are several mechanisms by which changes in estradiol might mediate the observed effects on mood. Estradiol and its receptors modulate the activity of virtually every system implicated in the pathogenesis of depression, including regulation of neurotransmitter synthesis and metabolism, stress axis activation, neuroplasticity (including regulation of BDNF), epigenesis, and immune system activation.  Indeed, estradiol signaling through estrogen receptor (ER) beta reverses depressive-like behavior in animal studies. We intend to initiate a protocol examining the role of ER beta in estradiol-withdrawal-induced mood symptoms. What remains unclear is the reason for the differential susceptibility to the mood destabilizing effects of estradiol withdrawal. Of interest in this regard is the recent identification of increased sensitivity to estrogen regulation among transcripts that were differentially expressed in women who developed postpartum depression. Thus we have begun experiments employing lymphoblastoid and induced pluripotent cells from women with past PMD and controls to examine the molecular basis of the differential sensitivity to estradiol withdrawal. <br />One possible source of the susceptibility to developing perimenopausal depression is an abnormal hypothalamic pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Dysfunction of the HPA axis is a frequent accompaniment of depression, and HPA axis function is modulated by both aging and ovarian steroid secretion.  We examined HPA axis function in depressed and asymptomatic perimenopausal women using the combined dexamethasone-corticotropin releasing hormone test. Results demonstrate that abnormalities of HPA axis function do not distinguish women with PMD from control women. These findings suggest that reproductive endocrine-related mood disorders are not uniformly associated with the HPA dysregulation and could reflect underlying pathophysiologic processes that are distinct from those reported in women with non-reproductive-related depressions.  <br />
