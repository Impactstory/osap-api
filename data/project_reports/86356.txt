This report includes work arising from the following protocol: NCT01434368.  There is surprisingly little known about either the endocrine events accompanying puberty in humans or the impact of these events on normal developmental neurobiology.  Epidemiologic studies have identified sexual dimorphisms in the prevalence of several disorders, including depression and substance abuse.  Many of these sex differences emerge during puberty and are maintained until the 5th-6th decade of life.  Basic neuroscience research has demonstrated that hormonal events accompanying puberty impact many of the physiologic systems involved in the regulation of brain function (e.g., the appearance of new neurons in a brain-region specific pattern, neuronal remodeling, and the pruning of cortical connectivity).  Consistent with findings in basic neuroscience, brain imaging studies in humans have documented the manifold changes in brain structure and function during adolescence.  While important and unequivocal findings about human neurodevelopment have emerged from these seminal studies, many questions remain to be answered about the role of puberty-related endocrine and metabolic events on brain development during adolescence.  In humans, puberty involves the (re)activations of several separate but overlapping hormonal systems that include the adrenal (adrenarche), gonadal (gonadarche), and the growth axes  each of which could influence brain development.  However, there is considerable individual variation in the timing, rate of development, and the relative synchrony of each of these processes.  Thus, cross-sectional efforts to link specific endocrine or metabolic events to developmental events in the brain have been difficult due to the complexity of the interaction in the physiologic systems changing during puberty, the lack of synchronization of endocrine and growth changes across individuals, and the non-specificity of the existing classifications of pubertal stage (i.e., Tanner stages) used to predict specific endocrine events.<br />We perform a longitudinal study of changes in brain structure and function, behavior, and stress responsivity in relation to a comprehensive characterization of reproductive function in normally-developing boys and girls who will be monitored every eight to ten months across the pubertal transition from age eight years (when they are prepubertal) until age eighteen years (post-puberty).  Reproductive endocrine (i.e., gonadal and adrenal steroids measured by high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry LC-MS/MS, bone age), metabolic (i.e., MRI and dual-energy Xray absorptiometry DEXA measures of visceral fat and body composition), and physical measures (i.e., anthropomorphic indices, MRI measures of gonadal volume) will be employed to fully characterize the stage, duration of pubertal development, and exposure to sex steroids.  Outcome measures will be derived via multimodal neuroimaging techniques, cognitive/behavioral assessments, evaluations of HPA axis function, and cell lines of induced pluripotent cells (to examine in vitro evidence of the effects of sex steroids on neuronal and glial function).  Additionally, we will test selected hypotheses emerging from the literature about the impact of genetic variation on the developmental trajectory of these parameters (both reproductive and CNS).  This cross-institute proposal employs a multidisciplinary approach to evaluating the effects on CNS function of the process of puberty in both boys and girls.  Finally, these data will serve as an important archival data set for extra-mural investigators to employ in their studies of children at high risk for the development of behavioral disorders.  This work will not only serve to inform research on the mechanisms by which sexual dimorphisms in neuropsychiatric disorders develop but it will have important implications for the prevention and treatment of these disorders.

<div class="data">
The protocol involved in this project is 11-M-0251. This report includes work arising from the following protocol: NCT01434368.<br />Recruitment for this demanding longitudinal study is in its early stages due in part to the successful development of imaging techniques required to measure gonadal volume in these children with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), the need for a designated functional MRI to be in place for the performance of brain imaging in this longitudinal, repeated measures study, and the successful piloting of several brain-activation paradigms to measure specific neural systems (e.g., the reward system) across puberty in children.  We currently have sixty children enrolled in this study and several children have returned for repeat visits. We have observed several important methodologic variables that potentially will inform future studies: First, age alone is not sufficient to determine prepubertal status since we have identified approximately 10% of girls who show advanced Tanner breast stage at age 8. Breast development was unilateral and reflected early estradiol secretion in these girls. Second, neither chronologic age nor Tanner stage are sufficient markers of sex steroid (i.e., estradiol) exposure in boys and girls, since we have identified abnormally advanced bone age relative to their chronologic age and controlled for sex (as measured by left wrist x-rays) in approximately 10% of children screened for enrollment in this study. Finally, we have identified abnormally increased or decreased BMI (defined by normal BMI percentiles between 15 and 85th percentiles) which is accompanied by alterations in sex steroid secretion in approximately 17% of otherwise normal healthy children screened for this study  thus emphasizing the importance of controlling for BMI in studies of the relationship between sex steroid secretion and brain development.  We are currently investigating the effects of these early changes in gonadal activity as reflected by advanced bone age on brain structure and function.  <br />Preliminary results of neuroimaging studies in this project suggest that pubertal stage contributes to several measures of adolescent brain development and accounts for differences between adolescent and adult brain development that were brain region-specific. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and myelin water fraction (MWF) imaging (mcDESPOT method) were acquired on a 3T scanner in 30 typically developing children (8-12 year-olds, 14 females). The relationship of DTI/MWF data to hormone and pubertal measures was tested. In this sample of 8-12 year-olds, bone age and Tanner stage were highly correlated with maturation of the corticospinal tracts as measured by both DTI and MWF. In contrast, gonadal volume and plasma steroid hormone levels were associated with minimal changes in MWF medial to the thalamus. These findings suggest that bone age and Tanner stage may covary with white matter maturation during the early pubertal phase, while gonadal volume and steroid hormones may be associated with more restricted changes in this early phase of development.<br />Additionally, preliminary results from the study of these children combined with ongoing studies in adults shed light on some developmental processes relevant for vulnerability to early life trauma and future psychiatric morbidity. There is evidence that the structural integrity of the uncinate fasciculus, one of the major white matter tracts connecting limbic and prefrontal regions, predicts amygdala activation to fearful faces  abnormal in some anxiety conditions including PTSD.  However, few studies have investigated the developmental trajectory of the amygdalas structural and functional connectivity.  In both children and adults, we examined the relationship between structural connectivity of the uncinated fasciculus and functional activation of the amygdala during viewing of aversive emotional faces.  In children, increased integrity of the uncinate fasciculus predicted increased amygdala activity and functional connectivity with the anterior cingulate cortex during viewing of aversive emotional faces, while this relationship was not present in adults.  These results suggest that white matter integrity may impact the functioning of the fronto-amygdalar circuitry differently in children than in the fully developed adult brain.
