This report includes work arising from the following protocol: NCT01434368.  There is surprisingly little known about either the endocrine events accompanying puberty in humans or the impact of these events on normal developmental neurobiology.  Epidemiologic studies have identified sexual dimorphisms in the prevalence of several disorders, including depression and substance abuse.  Many of these sex differences emerge during puberty and are maintained until the 5th-6th decade of life.  Basic neuroscience research has demonstrated that hormonal events accompanying puberty impact many of the physiologic systems involved in the regulation of brain function (e.g., the appearance of new neurons in a brain-region specific pattern, neuronal remodeling, and the pruning of cortical connectivity).  Consistent with findings in basic neuroscience, brain imaging studies in humans have documented the manifold changes in brain structure and function during adolescence.  While important and unequivocal findings about human neurodevelopment have emerged from these seminal studies, many questions remain to be answered about the role of puberty-related endocrine and metabolic events on brain development during adolescence.  In humans, puberty involves the (re)activations of several separate but overlapping hormonal systems that include the adrenal (adrenarche), gonadal (gonadarche), and the growth axes  each of which could influence brain development.  However, there is considerable individual variation in the timing, rate of development, and the relative synchrony of each of these processes.  Thus, cross-sectional efforts to link specific endocrine or metabolic events to developmental events in the brain have been difficult due to the complexity of the interaction in the physiologic systems changing during puberty, the lack of synchronization of endocrine and growth changes across individuals, and the non-specificity of the existing classifications of pubertal stage (i.e., Tanner stages) used to predict specific endocrine events.<br />We have begun a longitudinal study of changes in brain structure and function, behavior, and stress responsivity in relation to a comprehensive characterization of reproductive function in normally-developing boys and girls who will be monitored every eight to ten months across the pubertal transition from age eight years (when they are prepubertal) until age eighteen years (post-puberty).  Reproductive endocrine (i.e., gonadal and adrenal steroids measured by high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry LC-MS/MS, bone age), metabolic (i.e., MRI and dual-energy Xray absorptiometry DEXA measures of visceral fat and body composition), and physical measures (i.e., anthropomorphic indices, MRI measures of gonadal volume) will be employed to fully characterize the stage and duration of pubertal development.  Outcome measures will be derived via multimodal neuroimaging techniques, cognitive/behavioral assessments, evaluations of HPA axis function, and cell lines of induced pluripotent cells (to examine in vitro evidence of the effects of sex steroids on neuronal and glial function).  Additionally, we will test selected hypotheses emerging from the literature about the impact of genetic variation on the developmental trajectory of these parameters (both reproductive and CNS).  This cross-institute proposal employs a multidisciplinary approach to evaluating the effects on CNS function of the process of puberty in both boys and girls.  Finally, these data will serve as an important archival data set for extra-mural investigators to employ in their studies of children at high risk for the development of behavioral disorders.  This work will not only serve to inform research on the mechanisms by which sexual dimorphisms in neuropsychiatric disorders develop but it will have important implications for the prevention and treatment of these disorders.

<div class="data">
The protocol involved in this project is 11-M-0251.<br />This report includes work arising from the following protocol: NCT01434368.<br />Recruitment for this demanding longitudinal study is in its early stages due in part to the successful development of imaging techniques required to measure gonadal volume in these children with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), the need for a designated functional MRI to be in place for the performance of brain imaging in this longitudinal, repeated measures study, and the successful piloting of several brain-activation paradigms to measure specific neural systems (e.g., the reward system) across puberty in children.  Nonetheless, in the past few months, we have screened several children who were excluded from this study because they did not display a normal tempo of growth as determined by skeletal age within one year of chronologic age.  Thus, these participants showed evidence of early gonadal activity, and possibly, a subclinical form of precocious puberty that was not consistent with their chronologic age or their Tanner Stage.  We are currently investigating the effects of these early changes in gonadal activity on brain structure and function.  Most studies of puberty do not include bone age in their selection criteria and findings of alterations in brain function accompanying elevated bone age relative to chronologic age will be an important methodologic consideration to guide future studies of puberty.
