 <div class="rowdiv">
<div class="data">
In Part 1 of this study, our aim was to identify potential causes for the widespread functional dysconnectivity observed in schizophrenic brains by comparing brain function in healthy individuals with that in persons diagnosed with schizophrenia. Results from the few earlier studies comparing brain function in schizophrenia patients with that in their healthy siblings have been inconsistent. Our study was unique, however, in that it considered data from three different subject types: 32 schizophrenia cases, their 31 healthy siblings, and 44 unrelated healthy controls. With customized analytic software and techniques of our own design , we compared resting-state functional-magnetic-resonance-imaging (fMRI) data (collected earlier from all three groups by Xiangya University researchers in Changsha, Hunan Province, China) to identify differences in global and regional connectivity in the brain.<br /><br />In Part 2 our aims were to develop a new statistical model for analyzing longitudinal data (complex data sets consisting of many points collected over time) and to test this new model by identifying the tipping point for disease symptom onset and for the onset of drug effects. In earlier studies of how genetic and environmental factors affect human diseases, the diseased state was usually represented by a single measurement. With todays new influx of longitudinal data, many measurements can be used to give a more detailed picture of disease phenotypes. Understanding these new data, however, requires highly sophisticated methods of statistical analysis. To meet this need, we devised a new analytic method that can both track symptom changes over time and take into account such the effects of potentially influential underlying factors (such as gender, age, and disease sub-phenotype). To test our novel analytic mixture model, we used it to calculate the time of onset (both alone and with underlying factors) for both disease symptoms and therapeutic drug effects.

<div class="data">
Part 1. For our initial analysis, we parcellated the whole brain into 116 anatomic regions and 1000 functional networks, then analyzed connectivity within and among brain regions and networks. To test our results, we analyzed the same data using a multivariate classification method, which confirmed most of the connectivity features our new method selected. As expected, both comparisons showed widespread differences in brain connectivity between schizophrenia cases and healthy unrelated controls. More unusually, they also revealed unexpectedly large differences between cases and their healthy siblings. <br />Part 2. We now aim to refine our multi-sequenced mixture model for the analysis of series of data points in order to predict the tipping point when, in our test case, disease symptoms or therapeutic drug effects become evident. In extensive simulation tests, our mixture model has produced encouraging results. We will therefore continue to improve our model by making it more flexible in terms of handling missing data and will test its feasibility using real data, including data sets from the massive STAR*D study of persons diagnosed with depressive disorders.
