The Section on Integrative Neuroimaging, in the Clinical and Translational Neuroscience Branch, employs multimodal neuroimaging methodologies, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET), to investigate Williams syndrome (WS). This is a rare disorder caused by a microdeletion of approximately 25 genes on chromosome 7, typically by spontaneous mutation. The incidence is usually given as one in 20,000 live births, but new prevalence estimates are as high as 1 in 7500. With its unique profile of striking behavioral features, such as hypersociability, combined with differential impact on cognitive functions some only mildly affected while others, particularly visuospatial construction, severely impaired  WS is an intriguing experiment of nature that raises fundamental questions about the neurogenetic mechanisms of social behavior and of cognition, the modularity of mind, and brain plasticity in development. Because the genes involved in WS are known, the study of neural mechanisms in WS affords a privileged setting for investigating genetic influences on complex brain functions from the bottom-up. Studying this rare genetically-based neurodevelopmental disorder allows us to closely examine the genetic determinants of the function, structure, and organization of neural systems relevant to cognition and behavior, including, particularly, 1) the neural basis of genetically-determined visuospatial construction abilities; and 2) the neural mechanisms by which genetic factors influence social cognition and behavior. Each of our studies compares high functioning groups of people with genetic abnormalities in the Williams syndrome region with healthy individuals matched for age, sex, handedness, and IQ. By controlling for IQ, we eliminate the possibility that factors such as mental retardation or developmental level would influence interpretation of results. Working within this model human system extends and complements efforts to understand genetic mechanisms of behavior, and its pathologies, in the general population and in neuropsychiatric disorders where contributions of individual genes are small and phenotypes may be subtle and complex.<br /><br />Our studies of the neurobiology of WS are a four-pronged effort:<br />1) We continue to refine our knowledge of the WS brain phenotype in adults with the full deletion. In this population, we aim to further explicate hippocampal, fronto-amygdalar, and dorsal visual stream abnormalities by employing multi-channel structural and diffusion tensor MRI methods as well as new visuospatial and social cognitive probes for fMRI.<br />2) We apply our multimodal imaging battery to individuals with smaller deletions to better associate components of the neurobiological phenotype with specific genes.<br />3) Using our knowledge of the adult WS brain phenotype as a template, we continue to explore the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in WS-related genes in the general population.<br />4) Lastly, to study the development of the genetically-driven anomalies of brain structure and function in WS, a major initiative is a longitudinal multimodal neuroimaging study of high functioning, normal-IQ children with the full WS deletion, smaller deletions, and duplications (Dup7) of the WS critical region. Whereas study of smaller deletions lends invaluable insights into the contributions of specific genes to aspects of the WS phenotype, study of Dup7, in which the WS critical region is duplicated (i.e., three or more copies) rather than deleted, and opposing phenotypes, such as autistic traits and retained visuospatial functions, are expressed, offers opportunities to understand gene dosage effects.  Our experience and success in defining the adult WS brain phenotype, together with the collaborative and in-house expertise in neurodevelopment, provide a unique opportunity to make major advances in this area. <br />

Summary
 </div></div>
 
 <div class="rowdiv">
<div class="data">
The Clinical Translational Neuroscience Branch continues to work toward discovery of novel genetic contributions to brain structure, function and clinically relevant behavior and cognition, through execution of an ongoing series of multimodal neuroimaging studies of individuals with copy number variation in the 7q11.23 Williams Syndrome (WS) genomic region (hemizygous microdeletion of a contiguous segment of DNA at this locus). These studies have been responsible for seminal advances in elaborating the neural underpinnings of both visuospatial and socio-emotional aspects of the 7q11.23 phenotype. We have established that the visuospatial construction deficits in WS are linked to convergent intraparietal sulcus alterations, via multiple neuroimaging techniques, including voxel- and surface-based cortical morphometry, diffusion tensor imaging, and functional MRI. Specifically, in this brain region, we have shown that WS individuals harbor disrupted neural integrity, altered activation during spatial judgments, gray matter volume and sulcal depth reductions, and associated neural fiber tracts. Likewise, in pursuit of systems-level correlates of the hypersociability and non-social anxiety observed in WS, we have found decreased amygdala activation evoked by fearful face stimuli and conversely, increased amygdala response to non-social frightening stimuli, abnormalities that were linked to altered prefrontal regulation in structural equation models. We have also identified convergent alterations in anterior insula structure, function, and inter-regional connectivity, which predict the characteristic WS personality.<br /><br />Efforts this year have focused on data collection of these same measurements of visuospatial and socio-emotional systems integrity in a growing cohort of children with and without WS critical region copy number variation (i.e., individuals with one WS, two neurotypical, or three WS region duplication copies of the WS critical region) as part of our longitudinal WS neurodevelopmental initiative. Preliminary data from our WS developmental cohort, for instance, has already demonstrated parietal hypofunction during visuospatial challenge and altered social network activation during processing of socially salient stimuli, consistent with the hypothesis that both visuospatial and social neurobiological differences in WS are rooted in early life. However, this project seeks not only to expand knowledge of the WS-related brain systems in childhood, but also to identify developmental trajectory (throughout childhood) and gene dose-response characteristics of neural abnormalities underlying visuospatial and socio-emotional alterations in this syndrome using a longitudinal, repeated measures design. Though data accrual will require years of careful and concerted effort to complete, the potential for these studies to shed unprecedented light on genetic contributions to brain development is enormous. <br /><br />In parallel, we have undertaken studies of WS-associated DNA sequence variation in individuals without WS. This work has yielded remarkable interactions between genotype in the WS-associated GTF2I gene and a measure of trait neuroticism, harm avoidance, in predicting prefrontal response during an emotional face viewing task. In so far as GTF2I sequence variation affects the neural correlates of anxiety-related behavior, this gene may be of particular relevance to the dichotomous anxiety phenotypes present in WS. To the extent that this finding was identified in individuals without WS, such work exemplifies the translational possibilities of WS-directed research benefiting broader scientific understanding of key neural processes in the human brain.<br /><br />This work includes the following studies: NCT01132885, NCT00004571, NCT00001258
