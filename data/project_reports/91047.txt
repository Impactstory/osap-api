Memory deficits result from brain damage due to rupture of aneurysms of the anterior communicating artery, anoxic events, viral infections (e.g., Herpes encephalitis), degenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimers disease, semantic dementia) and other pathology that affects the ventromedial frontal lobe and medial temporal lobe. Amnesia refers to a cognitive impairment in a certain kind of memory, associated most often with damage to the hippocampus, medial thalamus, and frontal cortex. Memory is more than a simple record of facts and events; it permits us to embed ourselves in these facts and events to provide the feeling of a coherent, unified life experience. When amnesia is severe, independent life activities become virtually impossible.<br />Much research has focused on the role of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) in conscious memory. The current textbook view of memory is that it depends on the MTL memory system, which has two principal elements: first, that the MTL subserves memory but not perception; and, second, that the many anatomically distinct parts of the MTL function together in the service of memory. According to this view, the perirhinal cortex is part of the MTL, but not the ventral visual stream or object-analyzer pathway, which has well-known perceptual functions. An alternative, called the perceptual-mnemonic perspective, is that perirhinal cortex has a role in visual perception as well as in memory, and that it is part of the ventral visual stream. Much of the earlier work on this project investigated the selectivity for perirhinal cortex function in memory, as contrasted with perception. Our results demonstrated conclusively that the perirhinal cortex is important for both perception and memory. Recent work addressed the second element, the idea that the MTL functions as a unitary system. We found that the entorhinal cortex but not the hippocampus was essential for a particular kind of fast associative learning. Current work on this project aims to understand the interactions of the MTL with the prefrontal cortex in acquiring and storing memories. <br />Accordingly, the overall objective of this project is to understand how memories are stored in the brain and the way in which brain structures work together to subserve memory. The proximate goals of the project are to: (1) determine the neural bases for rapidly formed memories; (2) to dissect the precise structures within the MTL that contribute to fast learning of associations between images and actions; and (3) to test the contribution of structures outside the MTL to memory, particularly the prefrontal cortex. This knowledge is expected to improve the ability to treat memory disorders caused by brain injury or degenerative disease processes.<br />

Summary

 <div class="rowdiv">
<div class="data">
Human functional imaging studies have identified a distributed network of cortical brain regions that display temporally coordinated activity during wakeful rest, commonly termed the default mode network (DMN). The DMN is largely conserved across species and includes a number of subsystems that converge onto primary DMN core hubs in medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices. The interactions between these hubs and subsystems, and their contribution to the overall integrity of DMN functional connectivity, remain relatively unexplored. Because the hippocampus is vulnerable to a variety of neurodegenerative conditions that affect memory, we aimed to directly test the effects of damage to the hippocampus on DMN dynamics. Healthy adult male subjects received selective lesions of the hippocampus. Postoperative structural imaging confirmed the extent and selectivity of the lesions. Sex and age-matched intact adults served as controls. For DMN fMRI imaging, subjects were scanned on a Siemens Tim Trio 3T scanner using an EPI sequence (scan parameters: TR =1700ms, TE = 27ms, FOV = 384384mm, matrix = 6464, slice thickness = 1.8mm). Initial results confirmed that intact normal subjects display a temporally coordinated pattern of activity distributed across a number of cortical areas, including the medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortex, similar to the human DMN. Ongoing analysis will directly test, for the first time in an animal model, whether the integrity of the hippocampus is necessary for normal resting state cortical network connectivity.
