NIMH's mission is to transform the understanding and treatment of mental illnesses through basic and clinical research, paving the way for prevention, recovery and cure. For NIMH to continue fulfilling this vital public health mission, the Institute must foster innovative thinking and ensure that a full array of novel scientific perspectives are used to further discovery in the evolving science of brain, behavior, and experience. In this way, breakthroughs in science can become breakthroughs for all people with mental illnesses. <br /><br />The mission of the NIMH Division of Intramural Research Programs (DIRP) is to plan and conduct basic, clinical, and translational research to advance understanding of the diagnosis, causes, treatment, and prevention of mental disorders through the study of brain function and behavior; conduct state-of-the-art research that, in part, complements extramural research activities and exploits the special resources of the National Institutes of Health; and provide an environment conducive to the training and development of clinical and basic scientists. In addition, the DIRP fosters standards of excellence in the ethical treatment and the provision of clinical care to research subjects; serves as a resource to the NIMH in responding to requests made by the Administration, members of Congress, and citizens' groups for information regarding mental disorders; and analyzes and evaluates national needs and research opportunities and provides advice to the Institute Director on matters of scientific interest.<br /><br />The Office of the Scientific Director provides scientific, programmatic, and administrative leadership for the Division of Intramural Research Programs; promotes an environment conducive to productive research; and coordinates activities, establishes priorities, and analyzes and evaluates progress.

Summary

 <div class="rowdiv">
<div class="data">
The NIMH Division of Intramural Research Programs' (DIRP) scientists conduct research ranging from studies into the mechanisms of normal brain function, conducted at the behavioral, systems, cellular, and molecular levels, to clinical investigations into the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of mental illness. Major disease entities studied throughout the lifespan include mood and anxiety  disorders, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism and women's health. Because of its outstanding resources, unique funding mechanisms, and location in the nation's capital, the DIRP is viewed as  a national resource, providing unique opportunities in mental health research and research training.<br /><br />Susan G. Amara, Ph.D., serves as the Scientific Director for the DIRP and provides oversight to a diverse mental health research portfolio that includes clinical projects on autism, women's health, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, ADHD, mood and anxiety disorders; and basic projects geared toward answering fundamental questions related to mental health in the areas of cognition, genetics, learning and memory, and behavior. The portfolio also includes projects aimed at exploring new technologies and approaches to neuroscience such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG). The Scientific Director provides supplemental resources, as appropriate, to research projects in the DIRP portfolio.<br /><br />In FY2014, the Office of the Scientific Director produced a long-term plan for the DIRP and hired a Deputy Scientific Director.  In addition, the office hired a scientific advisor to manage several scientifically-oriented administrative functions, such as strategic planning, reviews by the Board of Scientific Counselors, annual reporting, manuscript clearance, organizing an NIMH-hosted seminar series, and facilitating communication with DIRP scientists. Regarding communication, a part-time writer joined the office to produce a monthly newsletter for the DIRP community.
