<div class="data">
Based on the fact that schizophrenia has an important degree of heritability, the objectives of this work are to discover and explore genes associated with risk for schizophrenia in order to generate hypotheses about molecular and neural system mechanisms related to key biologic aspects of the illness, and to identify new approaches to treatment that are based on validated mechanisms (Study 95-M-0150 NCT00001486, 00-M-0085 NCT00004571).  The strategy for biological validation of genetic association with schizophrenia is as follows: <br /><br />1)	Identify and validate important phenotypes linked to cortical dysfunction in individuals with schizophrenia and elevated schizophrenia risk by studying patients, siblings and healthy comparison individuals.<br />2)	Provide biologic evidence of the effect of schizophrenia-associated risk alleles on relevant measures of brain development and function assayed with cognitive and neuroimaging approaches in healthy and ill subjects.<br />3)	Use evidence  of genetic association with measures of brain development and function as a basis for further characterization of molecular pathways and mechanisms in human cell lines and in post mortem human brain in collaboration with the NIMH Neuropathology Core Facility. <br />4)	Use this knowledge to identify potential new therapeutic targets as well as predictors of response to available pharmaceutical interventions, as implemented under the auspices of the NIMH Inpatient Schizophrenia Research Ward<br /><br />Emerging hypotheses are tested using a convergent strategy of cognitive, imaging and basic science methods. Genes and gene networks that affect cortical function and increase the risk for developing schizophrenia are identified via family-based and case-control comparisons. To explore abnormalities of cortical function, which are core features of chronic schizophrenia, cortical function and structure of patients, siblings and healthy volunteers are quantified using functional imaging (fMRI), structural magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and neuropsychological tests. Results using these methods are combined with genetic data to look for genes that affect brain function and increase susceptibility to schizophrenia. To these ends, carefully diagnosed patients are recruited from local and national sources. Diagnosis of probands is established from previous psychiatric records and a structured diagnostic interview. Healthy volunteers and siblings are likewise evaluated with a structured interview. All subjects give a blood sample for genetic analysis. Evaluation of cortical function is performed using fMRI, PET, MEG, DTI and neuropsychological evaluations. The employed procedures have been chosen because they have been shown to be sensitive to abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia compared to normal controls. One particularly important strategy has been the study of healthy siblings of patients.  Over the years, we have shown that subsets of these healthy siblings show one or more abnormal traits on the above-mentioned tests, suggesting that these findings are heritable and that they may be useful measures for detecting genes that increase risk for schizophrenia. This study and the methods used are unique in focusing on such biological variables and their heritability in siblings.

Summary
 </div></div>
 
 <div class="rowdiv">
<div class="data">
During FYI 2013-2014, a number of major accomplishments have driven this project closer to meeting its goals of quantifying schizophrenia- and schizophrenia-risk associated cortical dysfunction, identifying candidate genetic contributors to this dysfunction, and assessing the importance of these contributors to treatment-relevant outcomes.  For instance, recent work derived from this project has identified important cognitive impairments in perceptual categorical judgments (Weickert, Terrazas et al. 2014) and category-restricted verbal generation (Nicodemus, Elvevag et al. 2014).  The latter observation has been particularly fruitful for elaborating putative schizophrenia risk mechanisms. Using neuropsychological testing and specialized computational linguistic metrics, we employed a well-validated category verbal fluency task to assay cortical function in patients with schizophrenia, their siblings, and healthy controls.  We were able not only to discover task performance measurements that were both impaired in schizophrenia and altered in individuals with greater schizophrenia risk (siblings), but also to then test whether specific genetic risk factors (SNPs previously associated with schizophrenia) might impact these same measurements.  Indeed, this series of experiments generated novel evidence supporting a role for DISC1, ZNF804A and KIAA0319 as important genetic predictors of these cognitive schizophrenia risk phenotypes. (Nicodemus, Elvevag et al. 2014) <br />	<br />Additionally, we have advanced our investigations of medication response mechanisms, leading to several new neurocognitive and molecular discoveries.  For example, we have helped to identify novel, preliminary evidence for antipsychotic medication effects on aspects of probabilistic association learning (Weickert, Mattay et al. 2013).  In a second instance of this line of inquiry, research completed this year has been able to support an important new role for variation in the neurexin 1 (NRXN1) gene, which has previously been associated with autism, intellectual disability, epilepsy, developmental delay, and also schizophrenia. We conducted a double blind, placebo controlled trial in 54 patients with schizophrenia from the NIMH inpatient study to show a significant association of NRXN1 SNPs rs12467557 and rs10490162 with antipsychotic response. Individuals homozygous for the A allele in both SNPs showed statistically significant improvement in positive and negative symptoms, general psychopathology and thought disturbance. However, patients who were carriers of the G allele showed no overall response.  (Jenkins, Apud et al. 2014)  Ongoing work in this same vein investigates DRD2, which codes for the D2 receptor  a target of modern antipsychotic drugs. In preliminary analyses of integrated post-mortem, neuropsychological and clinical trial datasets, variation in this gene shows important regulatory effects on gene expression, interactions with a key regulator of cortical dopaminergic function, COMT, in its association with cognitive performance, and holds promise as potent predictor of therapeutic response to both antipsychotic medication and the COMT inhibitor, tolcapone.  Multilocus studies of COMT, which may be particularly valuable in understanding mechanisms of cortical dysfunction in schizophrenia, (Eisenberg and Berman 2014) as well as other dopamine-related disorders (e.g., Parkinsons disease), have also progressed this year and have focused on neuroimaging outcome measurements in tolcapone trials.  Along with continuing advancement on several other fronts, including multimodal pharmacological trials with modafinil, this project is well positioned for even greater scientific achievements in the coming year.<br />
