Goals and Objectives

 <div class="rowdiv">
<div class="data">
Our primary goal is to continue to develop cutting edge fMRI methods and applications while maintaining a high level of utility of the facility resources for users at all levels of expertise. This high level of utility requires constant scanner maintenance, user education and interaction, and commitment to setting the standard as the best fMRI center in the world in terms of research quality. <br /><br />The priorities and major decisions for the FMRIF are set in bimonthly steering committee meetings, in which Principal Investigators (PIs) and their representatives meet with the scientific and technical staff of the center to discuss major purchases and technical priorities and projects. Communication with the broader user community is accomplished via a combination of broadly attended user meetings (interleaved bi-monthly with the steering committee meetings) as well as meetings of the scientific staff with individual research groups, which are scheduled on a rotating basis with PIs from NIMH and NINDS. The staff and director of the FMRIF are also regular participants in the monthly Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Facility (NMRF) steering committee meetings which set priorities and policies.<br /><br />Toward the mission of developing cutting edge fMRI and MRI methods, we are in the process of upgrading our two GE HDx scanners, and establishing a day of scanning on the NIAAA-operated Siemens Prisma 3T scanner. We are also actively developing real time fMRI, multi-echo fMRI, and simultaneous EEG and fMRI. This new technology will allow higher sensitivity, higher speed, and higher signal to noise imaging for anatomic and functional MRI.<br />

Summary
 </div></div>
 
 <div class="rowdiv">
<div class="data">
Protocol number 93-M-0170, NCT00001360<br /><br />Space Utilization:<br /><br />The Functional MRI Facility (FMRIF) currently occupies approximately 4800 sq. ft of space, divided between the scanner bays, control rooms and electronics/machine rooms for 3TA, 3TB, 3TC, 3TD, and 7T MRI scanners located within the NMR center and office space on the second floor above the NMR center in the FMRIF/SFIM suite (approximately 1400 sq ft total, including shared conference space).<br /><br />The FMRIF staff (currently 14 full- time positions) consists of: the facility director, three staff scientists to keep the scanners running, six MRI technologists, an information technology specialist, a programmer, a technical laboratory manager, and an administrative laboratory manger.<br /><br />The functional MRI facility supports the research of over 30 Principal Investigators translating to over 300 researchers overall. Over 70 research protocols are active and making use of FMRIF scanners. Each scanner has scheduled operating hours of 105 hours per week.<br /><br />Since its inception in 2000 until August 2016, a total of 1069 peer-reviewed publications from intramural investigators have used data acquired in the FMRIF core facility. The total is distributed among 716 papers from NIMH, 257 papers from NINDS, and 96 from the other institutes. These papers have been cited a total of 95,390 times for a combined h-index of 152. In other words, 152 papers using the FMRIF have been cited at least 152 times.<br /><br /><br />Projects: <br /><br />We completed installation of the high-density (128 channel) EGI MRI compatible system on 3TD and trained MRI technologists. The system is currently being used in pilot studies of ketamine on 3TD as well as a assisting with a study with Leo Cohens group that combines resting MEG and resting EEG/FMRI in stroke rehabilitation.<br /><br />Jan Varada has assembled an MRI quality control processing pipeline that will likely be used for making sure that the data quality remain of a constant high quality as the neuroimaging database becomes assembled.<br /><br />A standard workflow for the 7T pTX project has been established and submission is in preparation to allow human use of the 8Tx/32Rx system (in collaboration with the Jeff Duyn group). <br /><br />A new high-performance image reconstruction system was installed on the 7T that now permits routine use of multi-band, multi-echo (prohibitive before). We have demonstrated routine 2s TR, 1.1mm iso GE-EPI (100 slices). We have tested and installed multi-band sequences from CMRR, MGH and Maastricht. <br /><br />We installed and tested the Center for Magnetic Resonance Resaerch (University of Minnessota) Multi-band sequences on all Siemens scanners. These sequences are now being used routinely on 3TD for LBC protocol.<br /><br />We have gained access to a Stanford multi-band EPI sequence for GE MR750 platform. We are in the process of porting it to Epic 22.x for use on 3TC.<br /><br />Thanks mostly to the work of Vinai Roopchansingh, we have published the base GE (Orchestra) Raw Data to ISMRM-RD converter.<br /><br />We have ported NIH-EPI (supports multi-echo) to Prisma. The sequence is in wide use with researchers at NIH, and is being distributed (as a Siemens C2P sequence) to other sites. We also ported NIH-3D-EPI (i.e. segmented 3D EPI) to Siemens Prisma plaform. This is now in use with the Reich group (Pascal Sati), and is being distributed (as a Siemens C2P sequence) to other sites.<br />
