The Section on Integrative Neuroimaging, in the Clinical and Translational Neuroscience Branch, employs multimodal neuroimaging methodologies, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET), to investigate Williams syndrome (WS). This is a rare disorder caused by a microdeletion of approximately 25 genes on chromosome 7, typically by spontaneous mutation. The incidence is usually given as one in 20,000 live births, but new prevalence estimates are as high as 1 in 7500. With its unique profile of striking behavioral features, such as hypersociability combined with differential impact on cognitive functions, some only mildly affected while others, particularly visuospatial construction, are severely impaired, WS is an intriguing experiment of nature that raises fundamental questions about the neurogenetic mechanisms of social behavior and of cognition, the modularity of mind, and brain plasticity in development. Because the genes involved in WS are known, the study of neural mechanisms in WS affords a privileged setting for investigating genetic influences on complex brain functions from the bottom-up. Studying this rare genetically-based neurodevelopmental disorder allows us to closely examine the genetic determinants of the function, structure, and organization of neural systems relevant to cognition and behavior, including, particularly, 1) the neural basis of genetically-determined of visuospatial constructive abilities; and 2) the neural mechanism by which genetic factors influence social cognition and behavior. Each of our studies compares high functioning groups of people with Williams syndrome with healthy normal controls. These comparison groups are matched for age, sex, handedness, and IQ scores. By controlling these variables, we eliminate the possibility that factors such as mental retardation or developmental level would influence interpretation of results. Working within this model human system extends and complements efforts to understand genetic mechanisms of behavior, and its pathologies, in the general population and in neuropsychiatric disorders where contributions of individual genes are small and phenotypes may be subtle and complex.<br /><br />Our studies of the neurobiology of WS are a four-pronged effort:<br />1) We continue to refine our knowledge of the WS brain phenotype in adults with the full deletion. In this population, we aim to further explicate hippocampal, fronto-amygdalar, and dorsal visual stream abnormalities by employing new cognitive probes for fMRI aimed at dissecting the cognitive context of the dysfunction (e.g. verbal vs. spatial memory, navigation, and language learning), and we will use multi-channel MR methods to better define the hippocampal structural abnormalities; we will also apply new MR spectroscopic imaging parameters as they become available through our colleagues. Diffusion tensor imaging is expanded in this population to follow up on our intriguing preliminary leads.<br />2) We apply our multimodal imaging battery to individuals with smaller deletions to better associate components of the neurobiological phenotype with specific genes.<br />3) Using our knowledge of the adult WS brain phenotype as a template, we continue to explore the effects of specific genes by examining the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the general population.<br />4) Lastly, to study the development of the genetically-driven anomalies of brain structure and function in WS, a major initiative is a longitudinal multimodal neuroimaging study of high functioning, normal-IQ children with the full WS deletion, smaller deletions, and duplications of the WS critical region. Our experience and success in defining the adult WS brain phenotype, together with the collaborative and in-house expertise in neurodevelopment, provide a unique opportunity to make major advances in this area.

Summary
 </div></div>
 
 <div class="rowdiv">
<div class="data">
In order to delineate specific genetic contributions to brain structure, function and clinically relevant behavior and cognition, we have executed an ongoing series of multimodal neuroimaging studies of individuals with copy number variation in the 7q11.23 Williams Syndrome (WS) genomic region.  These studies have been responsible for seminal advances in elaborating the neural underpinnings of both visuospatial and socio-emotional aspects of the 7q11.23 phenotype. We have established that the visuospatial construction deficits in WS (hemizygous microdeletion of a contiguous segment of DNA at this locus) are linked to convergent intraparietal sulcus alterations, via multiple neuroimaging techniques, including voxel- and surface-based cortical morphometry, diffusion tensor imaging and functional MRI. Specifically, we have shown that WS individuals harbor disrupted intraparietal sulcal region neural integrity, activation during spatial judgments, gray matter volume, sulcal depth, and associated neural fiber tracts. Likewise, in pursuit of plausible systems-level correlates of the hypersociability and non-social anxiety observed in WS, we have found decreased amygdala activation evoked by fearful face stimuli and conversely, increased amygdala response to non-social frightening stimuli, abnormalities that were linked to altered prefrontal regulation in structural equation models. We have also identified convergent alterations in anterior insula structure, function, and inter-regional connectivity, which predict the characteristic Williams syndrome (WS) personality.<br /><br />Under the auspices of our new longitudinal WS neurodevelopmental study, we have now been able to accelerate collection of these same measurements of visuospatial and socio-emotional systems integrity in a growing cohort of children with and without WS critical region copy number variation (i.e., individuals with one (WS), two (neurotypical), or three (WS region duplication) copies of the WS critical region). Growing this unique dataset will allow understanding of both the developmental trajectory and gene dose-response characteristics of neural abnormalities underlying visuospatial and socio-emotional alterations in this syndrome. Though data accrual will require years of careful and concerted effort to complete, the potential for these studies to shed unprecedented light on genetic contributions to brain development are enormous.<br /><br />In parallel, we have undertaken studies of DNA sequence variation in individuals without WS.  This work has yielded remarkable interactions between genotype in the WS-associated GTF2I gene and a measure of trait neuroticism, harm avoidance, in predicting prefrontal response during an emotional face viewing task.  In so far as GTF2I sequence variation affects the neural correlates of anxiety-related behavior, this gene may be of particular relevance to the dichotomous anxiety phenotypes present in WS.  To the extent that this finding was identified in individuals without WS, such work exemplifies the translational possibilities of WS-directed research benefiting broader scientific understanding of key neural processes in the human brain.<br /><br />This work includes the following studies: NCT01132885, NCT00004571, NCT00001258
