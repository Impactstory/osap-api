The Clinical and Translational Neuroscience Branch uses multimodal neuroimaging methods as a brain phenotyping tool, with the specific aim of defining brain circuits within which to characterize the impact of allelic variation. The overall objective of this work is to use multimodal neuroimaging and neuropsychological batteries to generate a mechanistic account of brain function, development and dysfunction in order to understand mechanisms that translate genetic effects into risk for mental illness. <br /><br />To date, our work on the neurobiology of molecular targets of interest to schizophrenia has concentrated on healthy control subjects, in whom we have tested for genotype effects on cortical-subcortical circuitry and on the relationship between subcortical dopamine stores and cortical function. This work will continue to build the sample sizes of our multimodal data sets in all neuroimaging domains, a necessity for examining gene-gene interactions. Furthermore, the initiation of a dedicated longitudinal study of children and adolescents will allow us to refine our knowledge of developmental trajectories and neural maturation by gene interaction effects on the defined circuitry. In collaboration with the Section on Behavioral Endocrinology, we will also be able to discern how these neurodevelopmental changes may be linked to precisely measured pubertal advancement.<br /><br />This work involves the following studies: NCT00942981, NCT00001258, NCT00024622, NCT00004571<br />

Summary

 <div class="rowdiv">
<div class="data">
The Clinical and Translational Neuroscience Branch continues to make advances on several fronts in order to delineate the neurochemical, neurogenetic, and neuropsychological contributions to neural systems function and development relevant to mental illness. We have embarked on data collection for two unprecedented scientific resources: first, a unique multimodal neuroimaging dataset in adults that includes neuropsychological testing, extensive dopaminergic PET imaging as well as MR spectroscopy, functional and structural MRI; and, second, a longitudinal, neurodevelopmental dataset that incorporates structural and functional magnetic resonance-based brain imaging, and, in conjunction with the Section on Behavioral Endocrinology, precise, state-of-the-art endocrinological measurements of pubertal status. These comprehensive ongoing data acquisition efforts have resulted in a growing repository of integrated information about the brain, which will permit both novel analyses synthesizing disparate but interrelated indices of neurochemical (e.g., dopamine, GABA, and glutamate) functioning and discovery of critical genetic and endocrinological factors guiding neurodevelopment. <br /><br />This work has already begun to yield important insights into social neurocognitive processes, which inform models of abnormal processing of social cues in neuropsychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia, autism and Williams syndrome. In a series of multimodal experiments, we have taken advantage of magnetoencephalography, positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging methods to first identify heretofore unappreciated links between midbrain dopamine stores and how social neural networks react to viewing emotional faces, then dissect how specific types of such brain activity modulate over time as expressions emerge on a viewed face, and most recently, discover genetic association between the Williams syndrome region gene, GTF2I, and relationships between trait neuroticism and social neural activity.  <br /><br />Other recent efforts have focused on defining the impact of gene variants associated with schizophrenia and general cognitive functioning and has begun to evaluate new hypotheses about how sequelae of common genetic variation intersects with the biology of mental illness. We have successfully tied the heritable intermediate phenotype first described by this group  prefrontal inefficiency during the working memory N-back task  to a promising schizophrenia risk variant in the SCN2A gene. Collaborative studies have now confirmed genetic associations between variation in the SCN2A gene and both cognitive ability and interregional brain connectivity in a large cohort of healthy individuals.  In parallel, work this year has uncovered links between a genetic locus previously associated with educational attainment and broad cognitive ability.  We also remain engaged in studies characterizing the genetic determinants of key neurochemical phenotypes (i.e., MRS- and PET-based signals) that have been linked with neuropsychiatric illness.<br /><br />Finally, ongoing work is aimed at understanding the underlying structure of our neural systems and cognitive-behavioral measurements.  For instance, in view of increasingly prominent views that dimensions of psychopathology are extremes of more typical dispositional variation, we have now undertaken analyses of characterological and personality disorder assays of a large cohort of healthy individuals unfettered by confounds inherent in clinical populations.  We have preliminarily identified several prominent dimensions  Negative Affect, Detached, and Egocentric  that complement leading personality theories and may lend insight into latent personality trait structure regardless of diagnostic thresholds.
