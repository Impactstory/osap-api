Goals and Objectives

 <div class="rowdiv">
<div class="data">
Our overall goal is to understand how molecular changes in hippocampal subfields modify neural circuits that underlie memory-guided behavior. We are particularly interested in investigating the function of the dentate gyrus - an initial gateway of hippocampal circuitry that is crucial for acquiring contextual information during episodic memory formation. We are also interested in the function of the dentate gyrus in pathological conditions, since neuronal loss in the hilus of dentate gyrus, which includes mossy cells and hilar interneurons, has been shown to be a major pathological hallmark of human temporal lobe epilepsy. In this project, we use mouse genetic tools in which a particular gene can be manipulated selectively in dentate hilar mossy cells. The mossy cells in the dentate hilus receive inputs from the granule cells of the dentate gyrus and the pyramidal cells of area CA3, and provide massive recurrent connections back to dentate granule cells, thereby controlling dentate excitability. Therefore, mossy cells have been suggested to be important to the intrinsic computational properties of the dentate gyrus. However, the functional significance of mossy cells in the in vivo dentate network has not been explored. To address the role of this mossy cell-mediated dentate gyrus network in vivo, we generated two transgenic mouse lines: one is a hippocampal mossy cell-restricted NMDA receptor subtype 1 (NR1) knockout mice (mossy cell NR1-KO mice), and another transgenic line expresses human HB-EGF as a diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) predominantly in the hippocampal mossy cells (mossy cell-DTR mice). We have analyzed these lines using behavioral, in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological techniques. In our view, this line of research is most likely to provide definitive answers to some key questions regarding dentate mossy cell functions in epilepsy research, which will provide a significant step toward identifying the mechanisms to treat seizure disorders more effectively.

Summary
 </div></div>
 
 <div class="rowdiv">
<div class="data">
Earlier, we generated a conditional transgenic mouse line in which diphtheria toxin receptor was selectively expressed in mossy cells using the Cre/loxP system.  Within one week after diphtheria toxin injection, we observed 80% loss of mossy cells throughout the longitudinal axis.  We found no obvious or sustained epilepsy-like discharges in the hippocampus as measured by in vivo local field potential recordings. Interestingly, no mossy fiber sprouting was detected by Timm staining. These results suggested that, in contrast to previous reports showing that lesions of the entire hilar region induce massive mossy fiber sprouting and epilepsy, selective in vivo elimination of mossy cells does not trigger behavioral epilepsy or mossy fiber sprouting. This year, we found that dentate granule cells in the DT-treated mutants became hyperexcitable to afferent stimulation in in vitro slice preparation, and during this hyperexcitable state deficits in contextual pattern separation were detected.  We also evaluated the immediate-early gene (IEG) expression in response to kainic acid (KA) injection under the assumption that an excitatory stimulus would cause more granule cells to discharge and activate IEG expression in mutants compared to controls.  KA injection evoked Zif268 expression in more granule cells in mutants than in controls.  We also examined the KA-induced seizure intensity. The cumulative seizure score of mutants for the hour following KA injection was significantly higher than controls.  Together, these results all suggested an increase in granule cell excitability following mossy cell ablation.  In summary, we concluded that mossy cell loss in vivo renders the granule cells hyperexcitable.  Contrary to the predicted epileptogenesis implicit in the dormant basket cell hypothesis, however, it was insufficient to trigger the mossy fiber sprouting and epileptic discharges.  Perhaps, in addition to the loss of mossy cells, neurodegeneration of other limbic areas, such as entorhinal cortex, is necessary to induce medial temporal lobe epilepsy. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of epileptogenesis in the limbic cortex.  <br /><br />This year, for the manuscript forth revisions, To analyze the impact of mossy cell loss on in vivo brain activity in the dentate gyrus, we placed electrodes in the dentate gyrus to record local field potentials (LFPs). In comparison with the same animals/electrodes/behavioral state before and 4 weeks after DT treatment, LFP oscillatory powers at theta frequency (712 Hz) were enhanced during exploration in mutants one week from DT exposure. That no such changes occurred in DT-treated fDTR controls suggests that the transient increase in theta power in mutants is not due to DT treatment. DT injection shows no effect on LFP power spectra during immobility periods regardless of genotype. Since the theta input to the dentate gyrus in vivo is conveyed from entorhinal cortex by the perforant path to granule cells, transient elevation of theta oscillatory power may reflect a transient increase in granule cell excitability.  This result, again, support our conclusion that dentate mossy cells play overall an inhibitory role in granule cell activity.  The manuscript has finally been published (Jinde S, Zsiros V, Jiang Z, Nakao K, Pickel J, Kohno K, Belforte JE, Nakazawa K. (2012) Hilar mossy cell degeneration causes transient dentate granule cell hyperexcitability and impaired pattern separation. Neuron 76:1189-2000). We also published a review article on this subject, entitled &quot;Hilar mossy cell circuitry controlling dentate granule cell excitability (Jinde S, Zsiros V, and Nakazawa K (2013) Frontier Neural Circuits 7:14).
