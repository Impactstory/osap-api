The NIMH Veterinary Medical Research Branch is located under the Office of the Scientific Director and is responsible for the care and use of all laboratory animals utilized in the Institute's Intramural Research Program (IRP). The Branch is committed to programs of excellence in veterinary health care, animal husbandry, technical support and program administration. The program has been accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) for over twenty years. <br /><br />The NIMH VMRB provides direct support to NIMH IRP investigators utilizing animals in support of their research. The support includes, but is not limited to: a) assistance with animal study proposal development and execution; b) veterinary services; c) assistance with animal procurement, importation, re-derivation and exportation; and d) training. Veterinarians are on call twenty-four hours a day, seven days of the week. The VMRB: a) advises scientific staff on comparative medicine, model development, disease interference, and other potential research variables; b) advises the NIMH Scientific Director and the ACUC on animal care and use issues; c) recommends policies and coordinates the implementation of approved policies and regulations; and d) assures that the program is run in accordance with all current guidelines, policies, laws and regulations. The VMRB provides a wide range of veterinary and animal support services for the NIMH IRP inculding anesthesia and surgical support, as well as other specialized research services.<br /><br />Technical assistance for investigators is offered in the areas of surgical preparation, anesthesia, animal identification, sample collection/analysis, environmental enrichment, breeding, weaning, ocular phenotyping, pathology and animal imaging (MRI, PET Radiographic, etc.). Training is offered in animal handling, restraint, specialized surgical procedures and technical procedures (i.e. bleeding, injections, NHP Bite and scratch prevention, anesthesia, humane euthanasia techniques, etc.). <br /><br />Currently, the NIMH IRP uses mice, rats, and nonhuman primates in support of its research programs. The majority of these animals are held in central and shared facilities on the NIH Bethesda campus and at the NIH Animal Center in Poolesville, Maryland. The NIMH IRP also maintains one IC managed rodent holding facility and one satellite rodent housing area. In addition to the above the VMRB provides oversight for a non-human primate breeding colony maintained on contract. Direct support of the NIMH IRP is provided by the Animal Program Director (0.5 FTE), the Deputy Animal Program Director (1.0 FTE) an Institute Veterinarian (1 FTE), two (2 FTE) Government Administrative Personnel, and eight (8) Government/contract veterinary technicians and animal care personnel. Dr. James Raber serves as the Animal Program Director for both the NIMH and NEI. His position is equally shared between the two institutes (0.5 FTE).

Summary
 </div></div>
 
 <div class="rowdiv">
<div class="data">
The NIMH Veterinary Medicine Research Branch (VMRB) has successfully provided veterinary medical, husbandry and research support to over twenty-eight (28) principal investigators in the NIMH IRP with over fifty-seven (57) active animal study protocols. In addition, the Branch has provided training and support to over two hundred and sixty (260) animal users within the Institute. Throughout this fiscal year the NIMH Animal Program Director has also served as Director of the NEI animal care and use program. Both programs were again granted full accreditation by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) International this past summer. Through its commitment to programs of excellence in veterinary health care, animal husbandry, technical support and program administration the NIMH VMRB has provided program support and facilitation necessary to the mission of the NIMH and NIH. The VMRB continues to play a leading role in the NIH Animal Care and Use Program and as an active participant in the laboratory animal science community both on the local and national level.
