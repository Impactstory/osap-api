The Section on Integrative Neuroimaging, in the Clinical Brain Disorders Branch, is working to more clearly define the neurobiology of schizophrenia at the systems level, characterizing abnormalities in implicated neural circuits serving cognitive functions disrupted in schizophrenia and their neurochemical underpinnings. In particular, we examine pathophysiology in the frontotemporal system and in systems based on the relationship between subcortical dopamine neurons and cortical activity (Study 01-M-0232 NCT00024622). This work brings together measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) with oxygen-15 water PET (Study 90-M-0014 NCT00001258), neural activation with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (Study 00-M-0085 NCT00004571), and comprehensive pre- and post-synaptic dopaminergic function with F-18-fluorodopa (18FDOPA), C-11-NNC112 (NNC112), and F-18-fallypride (fallypride) PET (Study 09-M-0176 NCT00942981). This multifaceted approach has the potential to uncover distinctive systems-level phenotypes that may be helpful in the search for susceptibility genes for schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders, which may ultimately help guide the development of desperately needed new treatments. <br /><br />Because the neural circuits and neurochemical indices that are tested depend upon dopamine and other neurotransmitters that can be affected by neuroleptic medications, patients are studied with these multiple imaging modalities while they are medication-free. The Clinical Brain Disorders Branch (CBDB) inpatient ward and the drug withdrawal protocol in which many of our inpatients participate are critically important to understanding the pathophysiology, particularly neurochemical features, without the contaminant of ongoing neuroleptic treatment. The NIMH Intramural Research Program (IRP) is one of the few remaining clinical research facilities where work of this nature can be carried out. Similarly, this privileged setting allows for close integration with candidate risk gene discovery efforts from other investigators, permitting this work to provide an active database with which to test the neurobiological repercussions of newly identified schizophrenia susceptibility genes. <br /><br />Specifically, our current work in medication-free patients aims to describe dysfunction of basal-, reward- and executive cognition-related neural activity via fMRI and rCBF studies in relation to clinical indices, candidate risk genotypes, and correlative measurement of presynaptic dopamine stores using 18FDOPA PET scanning. In addition, we are assembling a comparison cohort of patients with early Parkinsons disease who can tolerate these same neuroimaging procedures while briefly withdrawn from their medications to examine the sequelae of a mechanistically different disorder of dopamine regulation. We further seek to refine our understanding of cortical dopamine economy in schizophrenia by incorporating into our research program the radioligands NNC112 and fallypride, which permit measurement of D1 and D2/3 receptors in the cortex, respectively. This allows us to directly test the theories that cortical dopaminergic tone plays a role in maintaining task appropriate network activity and that the ratio between D1 and D2/3 receptors influences cortical signal-to-noise ratios. These methods for testing the reciprocal prefrontal cortex-subcortical interactions that are strongly implicated in schizophrenia hold great promise for identifying the mechanisms that underlie this and other devastating neuropsychiatric illnesses.

Summary

 <div class="rowdiv">
<div class="data">
The core aim of this project is to elucidate the nature, molecular foundations, underlying neurochemistry, and clinical correlates of neural systems-level dysfunction in schizophrenia.  Toward that end, this year, the Section on Integrative Neuroimaging has successfully executed comprehensive, multimodal positron emission and magnetic resonance based studies of  a unique and steadily growing cohort of individuals with schizophrenia who have agreed to be studied under placebo (medication-free) conditions as well as matched healthy individuals.  Though this work is necessarily challenging to conduct, we have made substantial progress in data collection, which now includes characterization of dopamine-dependent mnemonic and reward-related neural responses, striatal presynaptic dopamine synthetic capacity, and both D1 and D2/3 receptor availability.   <br />This project has allowed us to identify and replicate specific schizophrenia-associated aberrancies of prefrontal activation and medial temporal lobe connectivity, suggesting frontal and temporal circuit disruption may be an important illness trait phenotype.  In line with this assertion, recent work has shown that individuals with schizophrenia and, to a lesser degree, individuals harboring genetic risk for schizophrenia demonstrate abnormal hippocampal activation and connectivity during memory encoding (Rasetti et al., 2014).  In evaluating contributing molecular mechanisms, we have found that candidate illness risk genes thought to regulate neuronal function in these same regions impact frontotemporal functional phenotypes and do so differently in those with schizophrenia relative to healthy volunteers.  For instance, we have discovered that in medication-free patients with schizophrenia, but not healthy volunteers, there exists an inverse relationship between dorsolateral prefrontal cortical and medial temporal lobe blood flow, which is mediated by COMT genotype, an important determinant of cortical dopaminergic tone. We have similarly shown in dedicated regional cerebral blood flow studies of the hippocampus that medication-free patients with schizophrenia show abnormal hippocampal activity under multiple cognitive conditions, but only if they possess a particular BDNF genotype, previously associated with reduced activity-dependent BDNF release in hippocampal neurons. (Eisenberg et al., 2013)  Together, this series of experiments elucidates a mechanistic explanation for variation in characteristic resting-state and cognitive challenge-related neural abnormalities previously identified in schizophrenia.  With further accrual, we will soon be able to follow up on this body of work to test important hypotheses about the neurochemical basis of these signature dysfunctions in schizophrenia, which could potentially inform future therapeutics.<br />
