Research in the Section on Neuroanatomy is concerned with the functional organization of neural brain systems, with a particular interest on the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia. This forebrain neural system receives inputs from all cortical areas and processes that input through the striatum. The striatum's output pathways provide feedback, through the thalamus, to cortical areas involved in the selection and control of behavior. Our work uses neuroanatomical methods to study the connectional organization of the basal ganglia to study the regulation of gene expression responsible for neuronal plasticity within the striatum.  Work in our laboratory established that D1 and D2 dopamine receptor subtypes are segregated in the &quot;direct&quot; and &quot;indirect&quot; striatal output neurons, which is the basis of how dopamine maintains the balanced function of striatal output pathways (Gerfen et al., 1990). Neuromodulators such as dopamine act to alter the long term response of neurons to synaptic input, such as the glutamatergic excitatory input from the cortex. Such neuroplasticity is mediated by the activation of neurotransmitter receptor-mediated activation of protein kinase signal transduction pathways. This results in the activation of transcription factors and induction of specific genes that are responsible for altering synaptic responses. We demonstrated that in the striatum, the &quot;direct&quot; and &quot;indirect&quot; striatal projection neurons support distinct forms of neuronal plasticity that affect responses to cortical input, through the differential activation of distinct protein kinase signaling pathways. Dopamine maintains these different forms of response. Dysfunction of the striatum following dopamine lesions in animal models of Parkinson's disease, appears to be due to a particularly aberrant form of neuronal plasticity. The aberrant form is due to a switch in the regulation of a particular protein kinase signal transduction pathway. The purpose of these studies is to better establish how disorders of the basal ganglia, such as Parkinson's disease, result in clinical movement disorders, and whether the basal ganglia might also be involved in such mental disorders, such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or in the abuse of psychoactive drugs.<br /><br />A major limitation of our and other research to relate neuronatomical circuits to both normal behavior associated clinical disorders is due to the complexity of their functional organization. While neuroanatomical studies in our laboratory have unraveled much of the underlying organization of the basal ganglia, research approaches to study the function of these circuits in animal models have been difficult.  One promising approach has been the development of genetically engineered transgenic mouse lines in which the enzyme Cre-recombinase is expressed in specific neuron types, neural circuits or brain regions. Combining such expression with floxed constructs enables the ability to experimentally manipulate very specific components of neuroanatomical circuits.  These mice are being developed and characterized to provide powerful new research tools to the neuroscience research community.  Our contribution to this effort is to characterize the specific pattern of expression of Cre-recombinase as part of the NINDS/NIMH funded GENSAT project.

Summary
 </div></div>
 
 <div class="rowdiv">
<div class="data">
    Advances in molecular genetic techniques are revealing new details of the neuronatomical organization of brain circuitry and the functional role of these circuits in behavior.  Engineered viral vector constructs have been developed to label axonal projections of targeted neurons with unprecedented clarity, while others allow for retrograde transynaptic labeling of neurons providing inputs or anterograde transynaptic labeling of post-synatpic targets of axonal projections. Development of optogenetic and DREADD techniques provide the ability to functionally manipulate neural circuits to study their role in behavior while calcium indicators provide the ability to analyze the physiologic activity in targeted neuron populations.  Together these approaches are providing new insights into the functional organization of neural circuits.  For example, optogenetic studies, using light activation of Channel Rhodopsin (ChR), have demonstrated the ability to functionally manipulate specific neural pathways to determine their role in behaviors including fear memory, anxiety, feeding, and movement.  The analytic potential of these approaches is enhanced by the ability to target specific neuron populations, which are defined components of neural circuits.  One approach involves the use of transgenic Cre-driver mouse lines in which Cre-recombinase is expressed under the control of gene-specific promoters.   <br />   During the past year we characterized BAC-Cre driver lines from the GENSAT project that allow for targeting components of the neural circuits of the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia.  Lines were characterized with selective labeling in cortical layer 2/3, in layer 4, in layer 5 and in layer 6.  Moreover, layer specific lines were identified with expression throughout the cerebral cortex, in specific cortical areas and in subtypes of layer 5 cortical projection.  Subtypes of layer 5 lines characterized include those with expression selective for pyramidal tract (PT) and intertelencephalic (IT) corticostriatal neurons. PT and IT corticostriatal neuron subtypes have been the focus of a number of recent studies concerning the functional organization of the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia, and will be used in proposed studies described below.  In this study some 20 BAC-Cre lines are characterized with expression in the striatum, including those with expression in both direct and indirect striatal pathway neurons, selective for the direct and indirect pathway, selective for the patch and matrix striatal compartments, and those with distinct regional distributions within the striatum.  Characterization of other BAC-Cre lines include over 10 lines with expression in select thalamic nuclei, and in other components of the basal ganglia including the amygdala, habenula, subthalamic nucleus, dopaminergic neurons and the superior colliculus. Together these lines that target specific components of circuits within the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia provide a resource for neuroscientists to study the functional organization of these circuits in animal models of neurologic and mental disorders.
